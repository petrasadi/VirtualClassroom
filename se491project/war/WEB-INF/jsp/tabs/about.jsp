            There are many ways to learn something new. You can ask a friend, read a book, go to school, watch a lecture
            online, or ... take a virtual class with an instructor. We believe of all the above, the value one gets is
            measured as unit of knowledge per dollar spent offers the best value.

            Welcome to Virtual Classroom - the online meeting place for students and teachers. Though not all
            functionality is available at this time, allow us to tell you about what lies ahead.

            As a student, you&apos;ll be able to register for classes that interest you, view and interact with the
            instructor, and ask questions. You will learn new things, be amazed with what you don&apos;t know, and at
            the end of it all be tested to make sure that you absorbed the material well.
        </p>

            As instructor, you&apos;ll be able to offer someone a chance to learn something new. Know how whales
            communicate or how to write bubble sort in ruby? Someone out there wants to learn from you.
        </p>

            So join in .. You&apos;ll like it here!<br>
